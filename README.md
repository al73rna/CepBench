# CepBench

A suite of softwares designed to analayze and simulated a large scale CEP (Complex Event Processing) system.

Tools in this suite will allow for forging multiple variations of "events" with many parameteres and sending them over the network by different means while analyzing the systems performance.

This suite was created to benchmark already existing CEP softwares and treats them as black boxes while focusing on the overall system structure and the variety and frequency of the events and other data.
